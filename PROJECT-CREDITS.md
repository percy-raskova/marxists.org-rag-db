## Project Philosophy

This project maintains strict ideological neutrality in content selection despite the lead developer's personal political orientation. The goal is faithful preservation and accessibility of ALL Marxist historical materials, including:

- Marxism-Leninism
- Trotskyism
- Maoism
- Left Communism
- Council Communism
- Anarcho-Communism
- Democratic Socialism
- All other Marxist tendencies

No content has been excluded based on ideological grounds. Technical decisions (like deferring ETOL/EROL) were made purely for resource management, not sectarian reasons.

## Data Source

**Marxists Internet Archive (marxists.org)**
- Volunteers worldwide who digitized these texts
- Decades of collaborative effort
- Non-profit, non-sectarian preservation

## Technology Stack Credits

- **Python**: Core processing language
- **Beautiful Soup**: HTML parsing
- **PyMuPDF**: PDF processing
- **Weaviate**: Vector database (planned)
- **Qdrant**: Alternative vector DB

## Future Vision

The domain **marxism.app** has been secured for this project (marxism.ai was already taken by the capitalists!), emphasizing the goal of making Marxist theory accessible to AI systems for research, education, and organizing support.

"There's an app for that" - even for class struggle!

*"The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it."* - Karl Marx

This project seeks to make that change possible by preserving and making accessible the theoretical foundations of revolutionary thought.
